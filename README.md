# engineering-simulation-control
Description : Mechanical engineering simulations covering load analysis, stress modelling, dynamic behaviour, and control logic inspired by real crane design and automation projects.
# Engineering Simulation and Control

## Purpose
This repository contains mechanical engineering simulations based on real design constraints.

The work focuses on safety, correctness, and mathematical validation.

## Topics Covered
- Load and stress calculations
- Centre of gravity analysis
- Moment and torque modelling
- Safe operating conditions
- Control logic concepts

## Engineering Approach
All models follow clear assumptions, safety margins, and validation through simulation.

## Tools
MATLAB, Simulink, Python.
